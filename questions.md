1.) What is a Single Page Application?
A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.

2.) What is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

3.) What is JSX?
It is an JavaScript extension where we can embed valid JavaScript objects into HTML elements. JSX makes Code easier to read and understand. Usually, HTML and JavaScript is written separately but react creates components that contain both HTML and JavaScript.

4.) What is Babel?
Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that converts edge JavaScript into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can run in any browser (even the old ones).
It makes available all the syntactical sugar that was added to JavaScript with the new ES6 specification, including classes, fat arrows and multiline strings.
We can also optionally use it to transpile TypeScript into regular JavaScript that will run in a browser.

5.) What is Webpack?
Webpack is a static module bundler for JavaScript applications — it takes all the code from your application and makes it usable in a web browser. Modules are reusable chunks of code built from your app's JavaScript, node_modules, images, and the CSS styles which are packaged to be easily used in your website.

6.) What is Create React App?
Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack.
